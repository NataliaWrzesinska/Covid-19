# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project (Jan-Jul 2020)

## Project Overview

This repository hosts an in-depth data analysis project examining the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, spanning from January 22, 2020, to July 27, 2020. The project's objective is to glean insights into the spread of the pandemic, its effects on healthcare systems across the 20 most impacted countries, and the efficacy of various national response strategies.

## Key Questions

This analysis endeavors to address pivotal inquiries:
1. What does the mortality rate between January and July 2020 indicate about the healthcare system's effectiveness in managing the pandemic across the top 20 affected countries?
2. Given the recovery trends and the death-to-case ratio during the pandemic's initial months, what conclusions can be drawn about the disease's severity and the success of clinical interventions in the hardest-hit nations?
3. How did the initial proliferation and apex of active COVID-19 cases differ between Poland and Germany, and what insights does this offer regarding the early containment measures executed by each nation?


## Tools and Technologies

- **Python** for data crunching and visualization
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for interactive data exploration

## Structure of the Repository

- `Covid-19-project.ipynb`: The primary Jupyter notebook encapsulating the data analysis and visualizations.
- `Covid-19`: A folder housing the dataset deployed in the analysis.
- `README.md`: The document you are currently reading, which provides a project overview and setup instructions.

## How to Run

Ensure Python and the required libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly) are installed on your machine. Clone this repository, navigate to the project directory, and use Jupyter Notebook to open `Covid-19-project.ipynb`.
